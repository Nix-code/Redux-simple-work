// sometimes we may have many reducer functions together
// we need to combine all those reducers in a index.js
// combineReducer is inside redux
// import { combineReducers } from "redux";
// import { productReducer } from './productReducer';
// // const reducers = combineReducers({});
// const reducers = combineReducers({
//     // key: val
//     allProducts: productReducer,
// }) ;
// // // created action, action-types, reducer, combined reducers , time to create store
// export default reducers;
